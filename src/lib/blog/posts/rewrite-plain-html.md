I decided I'd finally launch my own website as I've been meaning to do this for a while but
never made the time. I'm not a big fan of Javascript frameworks and found [this repo](https://github.com/arnath/vijayp.dev)
which has a very nice way of building a website in just html/css with python so decided I would
finally take the plunge by cloning this repo.

### Basic Parts

[This repo](https://github.com/dflaten/dflaten.devhttps://github.com/dflaten/dflaten.dev) contains all the
things needed to build the static resources. I plan on having this uploaded to S3 and then use Cloudfare to
handle the DNS routing.
